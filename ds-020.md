# Immutable Data Structures
* no part of object can be changed after it's created

## Why?
* mutation is common source of bugs
* immutable data structures are easier to reason about
  - value passed to a function, can't be changed
* immutable data structures are thread-safe
* bonus: memory efficient time travelling

---

# How?
* MYTH: to create new immutable value, you need to copy the whole thing
* we can share parts of the structure between old and new value
