# Immutable Data Structures

---

# Why?
- mutation is common source of bugs
- immutable data structures are easier to reason about
  - value  passed to a function, can't be changed
- immutable data structures are thread-safe
- bonus: memory efficient time travelling

---

# How?
- MYTH: to create new immutable value, you need to copy the whole thing
- we can share parts of the structure between old and new value
