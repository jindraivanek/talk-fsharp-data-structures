# Pure functions

---

Immutable data structures allows us to write pure functions.

Pure function:
- always returns the same result for the same input (referential transparency)
- no side effects

---

- BUT:
- referential transparency can be achived even with mutable data structures
- mutable variables and data structures are perfectly fine when not leaking outside of function
